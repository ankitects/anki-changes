<h2 id="changes-in-2159"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2159">Changes in 2.1.59</a></h2>
<p>Due to a packaging problem, this release was yanked.</p>
<h2 id="changes-in-2158"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2158">Changes in 2.1.58</a></h2>
<p>This release fixes an issue in 2.1.57 that caused cards and deck presets
to be reset to the default ease, if you exported a .colpkg with compatibility
with older clients enabled, or used the downgrade and quit option, then opened
the collection again. For the former issue, this occurred to the collection you
were exporting from, and not just the .colpkg file. If you were affected by this,
running the following in the debug console after updating should restore your
cards to the ease they were at when you last reviewed them, if they were not
reviewed after the problem occurred. Please make a backup before proceeding.</p>
<pre><code>updated = 0
for cid, old, new in mw.col.db.all(&quot;select id, factor, (select factor from revlog where cid=cards.id order by id desc limit 1) as factor2 from cards where type=2&quot;):
  if new and old != new:
    card = mw.col.get_card(cid)
    card.factor = new
    mw.col.update_card(card)
    updated += 1
print(&quot;updated&quot;, updated)
</code></pre>
<p>It will print the number of updated cards.</p>

<p>Released 2022-06-24.</p>
<p>A new CSV importer &amp; exporter, thanks to Rumo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows a preview based on the selected field separator.</li>

<li>Extends the header syntax so that files can specify metadata such as the desired field separator, and the mapping of fields.</li>
<li>The new functionality is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with a checkbox in the preferences screen. This also enables
the new apkg import/export code introduced in 2.1.52. If you use the Special Fields add-on, you will need to disable this option
in order to use the add-on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update to Qt 6.3.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes complex-language input (eg Japanese, Hindi, etc) on macOS being flaky.</li>

<h3 id="new-apkg-importexport"><a class="header" href="#new-apkg-importexport">New Apkg Import/Export</a></h3>
<p>This build also includes a new implementation of apkg importing and exporting, thanks to Rumo. Some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undo/redo is now supported.</li>
<li>Faster imports (especially for decks with a lot of note content).</li>
<li>Support for older clients can be optionally disabled, which results in smaller
apkg files, and faster imports.</li>
<li>Flags are removed when scheduling is excluded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new functionality is hidden behind a feature flag, and <strong>not active by default</strong>.
You can try it out by using <code>mw.pm.set_new_import_export(True)</code> in the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/misc.html#debug-console">debug console</a>.
To revert to the old behaviour, replace True with False.</p>
<p>Things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is new code that has received limited testing so far, so please use <code>File&gt;Create Backup</code> before trying it out.
Any testing/feedback you can provide would be appreciated.</li>
<li>While active, it is not currently possible to import/export files other than apkg/colpkg.</li>
<li>The Special Fields add-on will not work while this functionality is enabled.</li>

<h3 id="platform-specific-changes"><a class="header" href="#platform-specific-changes">Platform-Specific Changes</a></h3>
<p>Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 or 11 is required. If you are still using Windows 7 or 8, 2.1.49 is
the last build that will install on your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>macOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki now supports Apple Silicon natively. If you're on a newer Mac with an M1
processor, pick the qt6-apple download for better performance and battery
life.</li>
<li>The Qt6 x86 build requires macOS 10.14.4</li>
<li>The Qt5 x86 build requires macOS 10.13.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux builds need zstd to decompress, eg:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo apt install zstd
tar xaf anki-2.1.50-linux-qt6.tar.zstd
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The packaged version requires glibc 2.28 or later.</li>
<li>A wheel is now provided for ARM64 Linux, and requires glibc 2.31 or greater. See
<a href="https://betas.ankiweb.net/#via-pypipip">this page</a> for instructions on using it.</li>
<li>Both Fcitx4 and Fcitx5 support is now bundled.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="scheduler-changes"><a class="header" href="#scheduler-changes">Scheduler Changes</a></h3>
<p>The V1 scheduler is no longer supported. If you have not yet updated to V2 or
V3, you will be prompted to update when you attempt to review cards in 2.1.50.</p>
<p>This release includes a number of improvements to the V3 scheduler, mostly
thanks to Rumo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intermediate deck limits now affect their children. Please see the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits">scheduler
page</a> for more
info.</li>
<li>When new cards are answered, Anki now records their original position. When you later
export a shared deck without scheduling, the original positions will be restored.</li>
<li>The Forget action now gives you options to restore the original card position,
and to reset the card's lapse and repetition counters.</li>
<li>The gathering and sorting of new cards has been reworked, trading a little performance
for more intuitive behaviour:
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to sort notes or cards randomly at gather time, ensuring a random
selection is taken from all available new cards.</li>
<li>The gather order and sort order options have been simplified, but should offer the same
functionality as before. Please check your deck options after upgrading, as some users
may need to adjust their display order settings to match what they were using before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The overview screen now shows how many cards will be buried.</li>
<li>Added a separate option to control burying of interday learning siblings.</li>
<li>Fixed interday learning siblings not being buried during review, causing them
to reappear later after actions like an edit.</li>
<li>If you have more than 2 learning steps, after the first step, Hard repeats the previous
delay, instead of being the average of the previous and next step.</li>
<li>When a Hard learning step exceeds a day, it is now rounded to a full day, so the
delay does not vary depending on the time of day you answer.</li>
<li>Fuzz is applied more evenly now, especially with smaller intervals.</li>
<li>Fixed new cards not decrementing the review limit, which could lead to
more new cards appearing after the review limit was reached.</li>
<li>Review cards and new cards are now interspersed more evenly.</li>
<li>When using Custom Study to extend deck limits in the V3 scheduler, parent/child
limits of the selected deck are no longer adjusted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="editor-changes"><a class="header" href="#editor-changes">Editor Changes</a></h3>
<p>Most of these changes are thanks to Henrik.</p>
<ul>
<li>A redesigned editing area, and a redesigned tag editor.</li>
<li>MathJax has a live preview.</li>
<li>HTML source and rendered text can be viewed at the same time.</li>
<li>The HTML editor now matches the current Anki theme.</li>
<li>Images can be resized within the editor.</li>
<li>Fields can now have an optional description/tooltip assigned to them (thanks
to Matthias, Henrik &amp; Rumo).</li>
<li>The &quot;remove formatting&quot; button now offers a choice of what to remove.</li>
<li>Adjust color picker shortcut, and apply color when different color selected.</li>
<li>Reduced editor button size on Windows/Linux (thanks to Matthias).</li>
<li>Fixed IME input after pressing tab.</li>
<li>Fixed media files not being inserted at cursor position on Windows.</li>
<li>Cloze shortcut correctly positions cursor.</li>
<li>Added a separate cloze button to repeat the current cloze.</li>
<li>Lots of behind-the-scenes changes and fixes. Because of the extensive changes,
some add-ons that modify the editing screen will have broken (see the
developers section below)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features"><a class="header" href="#new-features">New Features</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Anki will now switch to day or night mode automatically depending on your
system settings. You can force day or night mode in the Preferences screen.
(thanks in large part to Rumo).</li>
<li>Reworked backup handling (mostly thanks to Rumo):
<ul>
<li>Backups are created much faster than they were previously.</li>
<li>Anki can now create backups periodically. The default is every 30 minutes; you can adjust this in the preferences screen.</li>
<li>There are new options in the preferences to control the number of daily, weekly and
monthly backups you'd like to retain.</li>
<li>The File menu now has an option to create a backup immediately.</li>
<li>Because the backup storage format has changed, backups created with 2.1.50 will not be
importable into older Anki versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reworked .colpkg import/export (thanks to Rumo):
<ul>
<li>When exporting, you can optionally target Anki 2.1.50+. When doing so,
imports and exports are faster, and media files will be compressed, but the
resulting .colpkg will not be readable by older Anki clients.</li>
<li>Collections are now checked for corruption when importing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An option to ignore accents in searches by default has been added to
preferences screen (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>The Card Info screen now updates automatically as you change to a different
card (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Added a View menu to the main window and browse window (thanks to Rumo). The
view menu provides options to zoom in and out, and to toggle a full screen
mode. Due to technical issues, the full screen mode is not currently available
on Windows when graphics acceleration is enabled.</li>
<li>A new TTS tag format that allows you to combine extra text and multiple
fields, such as <code>[anki:tts lang=en_US]Here is {{Field1}} and {{Field2}}[/anki:tts]</code> (thanks to Rumo). There are no plans to deprecate the
old TTS syntax - either can be used.</li>
<li>Added an option to add/remove sidebar tag to selected notes (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Be smarter about mapping existing text to new fields when switching notetypes in the Add screen (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Apkg files can now be dragged on the main window to import them (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Added a &quot;Create Copy&quot; option in the browse screen and review screen, to copy
selected note's contents into the Add window (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>You can now search for tags by regular expression (thanks to Rumo). One use
for this is locating notes that are tagged with a <code>parent</code> tag, while not matching
ones tagged with <code>parent::child</code>: <code>tag:re:^parent$</code>.</li>
<li>When switching Anki versions, an add-on update check is run on startup (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Make links with <code>target=_blank</code> work (thanks to Danish).</li>
<li>Added &quot;Forget Card&quot; action to review screen (thanks to Araceli).</li>
<li>Added Belarusian and Odia to available languages in the preferences.</li>
<li>Added a silent option (/s) for the Windows uninstaller (thanks to Patric).</li>
<li>Added tooltips to some browser columns (thanks to Rumo).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Anki now requires Python 3.9.</li>
<li>Anki contains some compatibility shims that should allow many add-ons written
for PyQt5 to work with PyQt6 as well (thanks to Aristotelis). These shims will
not remain forever, so it is recommended that you update your add-ons to be
compatible with Qt6 without shims. The two main breakages are the renaming of
PyQt5 to PyQt6 (you can support both by importing from aqt.qt instead), and
the requirement that <a href="https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/1406/commits/a7812dedc096627692ab3d7e64b90be632f52134">enums are
qualified</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re using Qt Designer to generate UI files, the Qt5 and Qt6 versions
need to be generated and bundled separately if you want to support both at once.</li>
<li>PyQt6 does not support the Qt resource system (pyrcc was removed), so Anki now
uses a different approach, and urls like <code>:/icons/foo.jpg</code> should become
<code>icons:foo.jpg</code>.</li>
<li>Henrik has spent a lot of time working out how to smoothly provide an API for
the editor, and investigating how we can provide types to make targeting the API
easier. This has required a number of refactorings, and some add-ons that were
accessing the editor will have broken in this update. While the code is
not set in stone yet, hopefully we're getting there. An example of using the
latest API is available here: <a href="https://github.com/hgiesel/anki_new_format_pack/commits/master">https://github.com/hgiesel/anki_new_format_pack/commits/master</a></li>
<li>The way Anki is packaged has changed. Most of the standard library should be
available now. If you notice any problems importing standard libraries that
previously worked, please let us know.</li>
<li>The aqt package no longer depends on PyQt, as either version 5 or 6 is supported.
You can specify the major version you want when installing - eg <code>pip install 'aqt[qt6]'</code></li>
<li>manifest.json now supports a 'homepage' argument (thanks to Abdo)</li>
<li><code>mw.progress.timer()</code> should now be passed a <code>parent</code> argument, as the
previous default of using <code>mw</code> prevents the timers from being freed after they
are no longer active. If you want a permanent timer, pass <code>mw</code> in as the parent.</li>
<li>Improved Python code completion/type handling in VS Code (thanks to Rumo).</li>
