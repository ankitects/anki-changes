# Changes in 23.10

Release: 2023-11-01

## Notable changes

* Anki's version numbering scheme has changed to year.month(.patch).
* Quite a few add-ons will need updates to support this release. Some [porting notes](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/porting-tips-for-anki-23-10/35916) are available.
* Support for FSRS (which improves upon the scheduling provided by SM-2) is now integrated into Anki. You can compute the model weights directly inside Anki, and no longer need to use custom scheduling. If you have previously used FSRS, please delete the text in the custom scheduling section before enabling FSRS, and ensure the helper add-on has been updated to the 23.10 version if you are using it. By @L-M-Sherlock with help from @dae and @asukaminato0721 in https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/2633, #2654 and https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs-rs.
* Anki now has built-in support for creating image occlusions. Select the automatically-added "Image Occlusion" notetype in the add screen to use it. Glutanimate intends to update his add-on soon to work with the new system.

* .apkg imports are able to merge changed notetypes, and can exclude scheduling data. By @RumovZ in https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/2612
* Performance improvements to things like browser loading in the official builds.
* You can now customize the video driver in Qt6 in the preferences, which can help to work around graphical issues. @abdnh in https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/2643
