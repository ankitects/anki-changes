# Changes

:warning: After using the latest version, if you wish to open your collection with an
earlier Anki release, please go to the File>Switch Profile menu item, and click
on "Downgrade & Quit". If you skip this step, you may get an error message when
opening your collection in an older Anki version, and you will need to return to
this version, downgrade, then try again.

## Changes in 2.1.35

Released 2020-10-02, build 84dcaa86.

- Fix issue where special characters (*, %, _) in the browser sidebar search terms are not escaped.

- Fix black area on alternate Mac build for line graph graphics.


## Changes in 2.1.34

Released 2020-09-24, build 8af8f565.

- Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.28+ where a newly created deck config would default to
  an ease of 130%. When updating, Anki will automatically change any deck
  configs with an ease of 130% back to 250%, and change any cards using those
  deck configs with a low ease back to an ease of 250%. Users who updated from
  an older Anki version and did not add new deck configurations should not be
  affected. If you have deliberately set an initial ease of 130%, please change
  it to 131% or greater prior to upgrading, so that Anki leaves your settings
  alone. Thanks to Aleksa for discovering the issue.
- Update the standard builds to the latest GUI toolkit version.
  Please report any improvements or regressions you notice.
- Dropped audio plays automatically again (thanks to abdo).
- Revert to older sound playing behaviour to work around issues

## Changes in 2.1.28

Released 2020-07-20, build 7d8818f8.

2.1.28 is a big update with changes in a number of areas.

- A reworked graphs screen:

  - Rewritten with new graphing tools for more interactivity.
  - Graphs can now be displayed for arbitrary searches.
  - Added a calendar/heatmap view.
  - If you need them for add-ons, the old graphs are currently still
    accessible with a shift+click on the Stats button.

- Reworked syncing:

  - Normal syncs and media syncs can operate in parallel, speeding up startup and shutdown.
  - Normal syncs no longer need to close open windows like the Browse screen, or close & re-open
    the collection.
  - Full syncs now show a progress bar.
  - Full syncs can now be cancelled, and both normal and full syncs cancel more quickly.

- Card generation changes:

  - Card generation now supports negated conditionals, and a mix of required
    and optional fields.
  - When adding/importing, if a normal note doesn't generate any cards, Anki
    will now add a blank card 1 instead of refusing to add the note.
  - Please bear in mind that if you take advantage of these features, older Anki
    clients may report the cards are blank, or try to clean them up when you
    use the Empty Cards feature.
  - Cloze numbers over 499 are no longer supported.

- Card template screen:

  - Changes are now accumulated, and can be saved or discarded when you close the screen.
  - The front, back, and styling are no longer shown at the same time. You can switch between them with ctrl+1/2/3 or cmd+1/2/3.
  - Added a search bar to search for text in the template or styling.
  - Added a dropdown to change the previewed cloze number.
  - Added a checkbox to toggle the filling of empty fields for preview.
  - You can now delete a card template even if some notes are only using that
    template - they will be given a blank card 1 instead.

- Scheduling:

  - The deck list no longer caps counts to 1000.
  - The overview and study screen no longer cap counts to 1000.
  - The deck list will no longer show a parent count higher than the limit
    set on the parent.

- Empty cards screen:

  - Notes will not be deleted by default.
  - Empty cards are grouped by note type.
  - Empty cards can be clicked on to reveal them in the browse screen.

- Database check:

  - Notes with the wrong field count are now recovered instead of being deleted.
  - Notes with missing note types are now recovered instead of being deleted.
  - Notes with missing cards are now recovered instead of being deleted.

- Unicode normalization:

  If you are studying rare CJK characters and wish to prevent them from being converted into
  modern equivalents, the following in the debug console will stop Anki from normalizing note text.

  ```
  mw.col.conf["normalize_note_text"] = False
  ```

- The standard Windows build has troubles with the AltGr key. This is fixed
  in the 2.1.29 beta, or [a workaround is available](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/altgr-shortcuts/67).

- The standard Mac build currently does not support native dark mode. If you
  previously enabled it from the terminal, please either try the 2.1.29 beta, or
  undo the change with the following terminal command:

  ```
  defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool yes
  ```

Other changes:

- Performance improvements to a number of screens.
- Fields screen now accumulates changes, which can be saved or discarded when you close the screen.

## Changes in 2.1.24

Released 2020-04-28, build 359b9f5c.

Searching:

- You can use `w:something` to search on word boundaries, eg:
  - `w:dog`  
    search for "dog" on a word boundary - will match "dog", but not "doggy"
    or "underdog".
  - `w:dog*`  
    will match "dog" and "doggy", but not "underdog".
  - `w:*dog`  
    will match "dog" and "underdog", but not "doggy".
- You can now use `re:something` to search via regular expression, eg:
  - `"re:(some|another).*thing"`  
    find notes that have "some" or "another" on them, followed by 0 or more characters, and then "thing"
  - `re:\d{3}`  
    find notes that have 3 digits in a row
  - When searching by regex, unicode case folding is used, so searching for `re:über` will
    show a card that has "Über" on it.
- `nc:something` (short for "no combining (characters)") can be used to search while
  ignoring accents, eg `nc:uber` will match both "über" and "Über". This behaves the same way as the "Ignore Accents" add-on, but is about 16x faster.
- You can now sort on the deck, card template, note type and tags columns.
- You can now use wildcards when limiting the search to a field, eg `field*:something`.
- You can now use wildcards when searching for a card template or note type by name.
- `rated:x` searches are now capped to a year instead of a month.
- You can now escaped double-quotes in a search - eg `"foo\"bar"`
- Single-quote searches are no longer supported.
- Because the searching code has been rewritten, add-ons that modify the search
  code will need to be updated to support 2.1.24. It is no longer possible to
  override the Finder class - add-ons will need to use the new hooks in the
  browser screen to either rewrite the search text, or perform their own lookups
  instead. The Advanced Browser add-on has already been updated, and can be used
  as an example of how to accomplish things in 2.1.24.
- Non-wildcard searches now do full unicode case folding (eg 'tag:masse' matches 'Maße').
- Wildcard searches do simple unicode case folding.
- The tag list in the Browse screen now uses unicode case folding.

macOS dark mode handling:

- Anki now solely relies on the night mode setting in the preferences to decide
  whether to show in light or dark mode. Some users wanted to run Anki in light
  mode while keeping the rest of their system dark, and there were various
  display problems when dark mode was changed after Anki started that couldn't
  be easily worked around.
- Users who only use dark mode, and preferred the native look of widgets in dark
  mode, can achieve the previous appearance by running the following command in
  the terminal:

  :warning: This will only work if your system is permanently in dark mode!
  If you switch between dark and light mode, the interface will render incorrectly.

  ```
  defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool no
  ```

  And the following in the debug console:

  ```
  mw.pm.meta["dark_mode_widgets"] = True
  ```

Database changes (mainly of interest to add-on developers):

- Anki now uses Rust's sqlite libraries instead of Python's.
- The 'db' object on the collection retains most of the same API as before, minimizing the amount of immediate code changes that are required.
- Custom sql functions are no longer supported, and named DB arguments (eg "where id = :id") are deprecated.
- The old database code remains in db.py, and add-ons can continue to use it for accessing
  their own databases.
- The database is now behind a mutex, and can be safely accessed from a background thread.
- Various screens like the database check have been updated to run on a background thread,
  so they no longer lock up the UI while they're running.
- The database progress handler has been removed. Anki previous had sqlite call back into
  Python periodically during long-running DB operations so it could drain the UI queue,
  but this would vary in choppyness depending on the type of DB operation being performed,
  and it was the cause of some crashes in the past. Add-ons that perform long-running operations
  should instead use mw.taskman.run_in_background() or their own threading solution moving forward.

Other changes:

- A tweak which should fix some broken add-ons from preventing the collection from being loaded.
- Add socks support to media sync.
- Allow dragging fields to change their position (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).
- Allow selecting add-on config help text (thanks to ijgnd).
- Allow the type answer arrow to be styled (thanks to Evandro).
- Anki will now wait for a media sync to complete or be aborted before closing the collection.
- Build improvements (thanks to Evandro).
- Changed the way cloze deletions in RTL fields are handled, which should address some corner cases.
- Clean up the previewing code (thanks to Arthur). Add-ons that modify the preview screen will need updating.
- Don't force a full sync when DB check finds cards with a high due number.
- Don't show a popup when a network error occurs while syncing media.
- Fixed a case where decks could be sorted incorrectly (thanks to Arthur).
- Fixed a useless log file being created when exporting.
- Fixed add-ons with multiple branches not updating properly.
- Fixed an error that could occur when performing an operation in the browse screen then immediately closing it.
- Fixed Anki closing after a full sync on collection load.
- Fixed current card sometimes not being centered when searching.
- Fixed deck_browser_did_render hook.
- Fixed editor buttons not being highlighted (thanks to Simone).
- Fixed interface getting stuck when a corrupt collection was encountered.

- Fixed progress dialogs failing to appear in a timely manner.
- Fixed tag searches in custom study (thanks to zjosua).
- Fixed the collection_did_load add-on hook.
- Fixed the wrong language shown in the preferences screen for some languages.
- GitHub now checks Windows and Mac builds as well (thanks to Evandro).
- Handle renamed cloze fields when previewing (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).
- Ignore .DS_Store files in the media trash folder.
- Improved invalid HTML/JS error messages (thanks to Evandro).
- Improved the handling of deck deletions (thanks to Arthur).
- Improvements to debug console (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).
- Left-align tags in the browser.
- Media syncs no longer take time to abort.
- More hooks (thanks to Arthur).
- Moved the scheduling options in the preferences to a separate tab, so options fit on the screen even on devices with small screens.
- Prepare for uploading releases to PyPI (thanks to Evandro).
- The media check will now fix file references in fields that broke because a filename was shortened as part of a sync.
- Updated config handling. While there should be no immediate breakages, if you're an add-on author and
  store lists or dicts in Anki's config, please see 676f4e74a.

## Changes in 2.1.23

Released 2020-03-19, build de9543ff.

A macOS-only build that fixes a problem syncing media files
with non-Latin filenames added by previous Anki versions on macOS.

Please see 2.1.22 below for the bulk of the changes.

## Changes in 2.1.22

Released 2020-03-18, build 0ecc189a.

Media syncing improvements:

- Media syncing now happens in the background, so you can continue using
  Anki while the media sync completes.
- Aside from syncing at open and close, Anki will sync any media changes
  every 15-20 minutes.
- You can click on the sync button while the spinner is active to monitor
  progress.
- Long filenames and problematic characters should be handled smoothly now,
  instead of causing syncing errors.
- Anki should no longer sometimes forget to download files when a media
  sync fails due to network errors.
- When media files are added within Anki, Anki now marks them
  in the database immediately, which can make things faster for people with
  slower disks if they are not modifying the media folder externally.

Media check improvements:

- The Check Media function now shows progress, and can be interrupted.
- There is now a separate button to generate missing LaTeX.
- If LaTeX fails to build, the problem card will be revealed in the browse
  screen.
- When Anki finds files that are too long or would cause errors on some
  operating systems, it will automatically rename them and update your notes
  to point to the new filename.

Both media sync and the media check now place deleted files in a media.trash
folder inside your profile, instead of placing the files in the system trash.
You can use the Check Media function to either empty the trash, or restore
the deleted files back to your media folder.

Other changes:

- You can now export .apkg files with the V2 scheduler enabled.
- Add "New #" prefix to the due column for new cards.

- Updates to the translation infrastructure, including tweaks to the way
  the answer buttons and the review history screen show intervals.

## Changes in 2.1.21

# Changes in 2.1.6

Released 2018-12-10.

Downloads are now split into a standard and alternate version.

**The standard version**:

- Is built with the latest toolkit, which fixes various issues.

- Changes the undo shortcut back to Ctrl+Z or Command+Z like Anki 2.0.

- Includes a separate anki-console.exe executable in the Windows build
  that may be useful for add-on authors.

- Includes support for the fcitx input method and a gtk2 theme in the
  Linux build.

You can switch between the standard and alternate 2.1.6 without
problems. If you move back to a previous Anki 2.1 release, your sync
login details and window positions will be lost, and will need to be set
again.

**The standard version has updated requirements**:

- The Windows build only supports 64 bit Windows 7 or later, and will
  not run on a 32 bit install.

- The Mac build requires macOS 10.12 or later.

- The Linux build requires a Linux distribution from approximately
  2016 or later.

The alternate version is similar to previous Anki 2.1 releases, and is
built with an older toolkit. It will run on some older systems that the
standard version will not, but as it is not as up to date, it may be
missing bugfixes and security improvements that the standard version
includes.

**The alternate version will run on**:

- Windows 7 32 bit or 64 bit installs

- Mac 10.10 or later.

- A Linux distro from around 2014 or later.

**In addition to the toolkit upgrade, there have been some changes in
Anki itself**:

- Improvements to the Browse screen and flagging:

  - Search text is normalized, which fixes problems searching for
    unicode characters with multiple possible encodings.

  - The selection is now partially transparent, allowing you to see
    the underyling colours of the rows.

  - The screen doesn’t scroll when performing actions that don’t
    change the selection count.

  - Flags now toggle on and off, and the separate clear flag action
    has been removed.

  - The second flag is now orange instead of purple.

  - Find&replace now only shows fields relevant to the notes you’ve
    selected, and is case insensitive.

  - Fix card list not updating when editing HTML.

- Importing apkgs is now more verbose about how notes have been
  handled.

- Prevent errors caused by the user adding a field reference to itself
  on a field.

- Better handle issues with the deck list, such as decks that are
  missing a parent deck.

  configured for localhost connections.

  bold text.

  similar names could be removed as well.

# Changes in Anki 2.1

## Translations

- [日本語](http://rs.luminousspice.com/changeinanki2/)

## At a glance

- Anki 2.1 uses the same scheduling, syncing and file format as Anki
  2.0.x, so you can upgrade and downgrade at will.

- It’s built with recent support libraries (Python 3.6, Qt 5.9/5.12),
  bringing fixes for crashes, better handling of high resolution
  displays, non-Latin text, and the latest web standards.

- It requires a modern system - Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, or a Linux
  distro from around 2014+.

- Add-ons will need to be updated to work with 2.1.

## Add-ons

Add-ons need to be updated to work with Anki 2.1. [Some
add-ons](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1) have already been
updated; others have not been ported yet.

When you install 2.1, it will create a separate folder for add-ons, and
not import any existing ones you have installed.

If you’re an add-on author, you can read more about the required changes
on <https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons.html>

## Other changes

Anki 2.1 brings numerous bugfixes, and some quality of life
improvements, such as:

- Built in MathJax support

- A "restore backup" option in the profiles screen

- SVG rendering support for LaTeX

- Improved add-on configuration, management and updating

- Night mode for reviewing

- Improved pasting, with less unnecessary formatting included, and
  better handling of media links. You can hold the shift key when
  pasting to allow more formatting to be included.

The Browse screen has been simplified:

- Various shortcuts that were previously in the sidebar are now
  available via the Filter button. If you find yourself frequently
  accessing certain items, you can save the search to have them appear
  in the side bar.

- The top bar with common shortcuts has been removed. You can access
  all actions quickly by right clicking or ctrl+clicking in the card
  list instead, and there is an add-on available for adding back the
  top bar if you still prefer it.

A full list of changes made during the alpha and beta period are
documented [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/beta.html).

## Experimental scheduler

Anki 2.1 contains an optional, [experimental
scheduler](https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/experiment-scheduling-changes-in-anki-21).
The experimental scheduler is not compatible with older Anki versions.
